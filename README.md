This is a boilerplate template API with some basic utilities that is used in almost every API. Created for the sole purpose of grabbing pieces of code to get an API project up and running fast. It is still a work in progress, although work on this has stalled for the time being. Anyone is welcome to use the code and utilities provided here if it can help them bootstrap basic functionality faster.

PLEASE NOTE: This is just a template project and is not intended to just work out of the box.
